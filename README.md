# Cluster-based-Colocalization
Description:  This program does cluster-based colocalization. In other words, this program indicates how well clusters colocalize, unlike the purely pixel-wise calculations done in Imaris. The inputs are the eroded and thresholded images that were used in the clustering analysis. However, the software also finds and uses the clustering results for these calculations. A variety of outputs such as images, text files and an interface to Imaris are included so that the extent of colocalization of clusters can be examined. With this program, you are able to dilate the colocalization parameter so that colocalization can be defined as when pixels from clusters in different channels are within one pixel of one another. In addition, you can continuously change the clusters that are examined by defining the threshold of colocalization (colocalization percentage).   Dependencies: Matlab with Image Processing Toolbox Imaris 7, 8 or 9 Installation:  Run colocalization_gui.m. More detailed directions are located in the associated *.pdf document.
